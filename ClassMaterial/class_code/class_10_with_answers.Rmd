## Overview


The focus of today's class is to revisit the hypothesis tests for two means but using: 

* dplyr to filter the data
* writing a function that can run hypothesis tests
* comparing permutation tests to t-distributions and t-tests




<!--  Please run the code in the  R chunk below once. This will install some packages and download data needed for these exercises.  -->

```{r message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# makes sure you have all the packages we have used in class installed

```





<!-- The R chunk below sets some parameters that will be used in the rest of the document. Please ignore it and do not modify it. -->
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, echo = FALSE}

library(knitr)
library(latex2exp)

options(scipen=999)

opts_chunk$set(tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60))
set.seed(123)  # set the random number generator to always give the same random numbers

## Part 1: Preliminaries note on logical AND (&) and OR (|)

The AND (&) and OR (|) operators are used to connect two Boolean expressions: 

* The AND (&) returns TRUE if both expressions are TRUE.
* The | operator  returns TRUE if either expressions are TRUE.



```{r}

# Exploring the AND (&) operator

TRUE & TRUE
TRUE & FALSE


# Exploring the OR (|) operator

TRUE | TRUE
TRUE | FALSE
FALSE | FALSE

```











## Part 2: Do diamond prices differ depending on the quality of the cut? 


To gain practice with dplyr and writing functions, let's revisit hypothesis tests for comparing the price of fair cut and ideal cut diamonds. 



$\\$




**Part 2.0a** 

Let's recreate our `fair_price` vector that has diamonds with `Fair` cut, and the `ideal_price` vector that contains the prices for all the diamonds corresponding to the `Ideal` cut using dplyr. 



```{r diamond_data}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)


# let's use the dplyr glimpse() function to look at this data frame
glimpse(diamonds)


# let's get the fair cut diamonds


# version 1
fair_price <- filter(diamonds, cut == "Fair")$price


# version 2: using the pipe operator and the pull() function to extract a variable
fair_price <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(cut == "Fair") %>%
  pull(price)


# get the ideal cut diamonds vector
ideal_price <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(cut == "Ideal") %>%
  pull(price)


```






$\\$





In parts 2.1 to 2.5 you will now do the 5 steps to run a hypothesis test!



$\\$




**Part 2.1** Let's start our hypothesis testing in the usual way by stating the null and alternative hypotheses. Although you might have a prior expectation that one of the diamonds cuts will have a higher average price than the other, please state the alternative hypothesis in a non-directional way such that you are testing whether the average prices of the `Fair` cut and `Ideal` are different, not that one price is higher than the other. 


In symbols: 

 * $H_0$ : $\mu_{fair} = \mu_{ideal}$ 

 * $H_a$ : $\mu_{fair} \ne \mu_{ideal}$
 

$\alpha$ = 0.05.

**Part 2.2a**  Let's calculate the value of that observed statistic using the original data frame and dplyr.


```{r observed_statistic, warning = FALSE}


# getting the mean diamond price for all cuts
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price))


# getting the mean diamond price for fair and ideal cuts
the_prices <- diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarize(mean_price = mean(price)) %>%
  filter(cut %in% c("Fair", "Ideal"))


# create the observed statistic
(obs_stat <- (the_prices$mean_price[1] - the_prices$mean_price[2]))


```








$\\$



**Part 2.2b**  Let's write a function to compute the observed statistic 


```{r obs_stat_function}


# a function that computes the difference between means
mean_diff <- function(sample1, sample2) {
  mean(sample1) - mean(sample2)
}



# test out the mean_diff() function on our diamond price vectors
mean_diff(fair_price, ideal_price)



# let's write a function that computes the t-statistic
get_t_stat <- function(sample1, sample2) {
  
  numerator <- mean(sample1) - mean(sample2)
  denominator <- sqrt(var(sample1)/length(sample1) + var(sample2)/length(sample2))
  
  numerator/denominator 
  
}


# test out the get_t_stat() function on our diamond price vectors
get_t_stat(fair_price, ideal_price)



```






$\\$





**Part 2.3**  Let's create the null distribution using different statistics.


```{r null_distribution}


# calculate the observed statistic using our functions

# obs_stat <- mean_diff(fair_price, ideal_price)
obs_stat <- get_t_stat(fair_price, ideal_price)



combined_conditions <- c(fair_price, ideal_price)

n_fair <- length(fair_price)
n_combined <- length(combined_conditions)


# compute the full null distribution 
  null_dist <- NULL
  for (i in 1:10000)
  {
    shuffled_conditions <- sample(combined_conditions)
    shuff_fair <- shuffled_conditions[1:n_fair]
    shuff_ideal <- shuffled_conditions[(n_fair + 1):n_combined]

    # original code, replace with our function
    # null_dist[i] <- mean(shuff_fair) - mean(shuff_ideal)
    
    #null_dist[i] <- mean_diff(shuff_fair, shuff_ideal)
    null_dist[i] <- get_t_stat(shuff_fair, shuff_ideal)

      
  }
 
  
  # plot the null distribution
  hist(null_dist, n = 100, 
       xlab = "Null statistic values", 
       main = "Null distribution", xlim = c(-10, 10))
  
  abline(v = obs_stat, col = "red")
  abline(v = -1 * obs_stat, col = "red")

 
  
``` 


$\\$





**Part 2.4 (5 points)** Let's use if statements to get p-values in different tails




```{r}

alternative <- "two_sided"   # "greater", "less"


if (alternative == "two_sided") {
  
  # get the two-sided p-value
  num_upper_tail <- sum(null_dist >= abs(obs_stat))  
  num_lower_tail <-  sum(null_dist <= -1 * abs(obs_stat))

  (p_value <- (num_upper_tail + num_lower_tail)/length(null_dist) )
  

} else if (alternative == "greater") {
    
      num_upper_tail <- sum(null_dist >= obs_stat)
      p_value <- num_upper_tail/length(null_dist)
    
} else if (alternative == "less") { 
  
      num_lower_tail <-  sum(null_dist <= obs_stat)
      p_value <- num_lower_tail/length(null_dist)

    
} else {
    
    stop("alternative must be either 'two_sided', 'greater', 'less'")
    
}
  
  

```









$\\$



**Part 2.5 (5 points)** Are the results statistically significant? Do you believe there is a difference between these groups? Are these results surprising at all? 







$\\$








**Part 2.6** Let's compare the distribution permutation null distribution using the t-statistic to a parametric t-distribution. 


```{r t_test}


# plot the t density function 
degree_free <- min(length(fair_price) - 1, length(ideal_price) - 1)

x <- seq(-4, 4, by = .001)
y <- dt(x, df = degree_free)

plot(x, y, type = "l", 
     main = "The t density function")




# compare the t-density function to the null distribution 
  # plot the null distribution
  hist(null_dist, n = 100, freq = FALSE,
       xlab = "Null statistic values", 
       main = "Null distribution", xlim = c(-10, 10))
  
  abline(v = obs_stat, col = "red")
  abline(v = -1 * obs_stat, col = "red")

  
  points(x, y, type = "l", col = "green")
  

```






$\\$







**Part 2.7** Let's get the p-value from a t-distribution.


```{r p_val_t_dist}


lower_pval <- pt(-1 * abs(obs_stat), df = degree_free)
upper_pval <- pt(abs(obs_stat), df = degree_free, lower.tail = FALSE)

p_val <- lower_pval + upper_pval



(t_test_results <- t.test(fair_price, ideal_price))



```
