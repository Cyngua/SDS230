 * Hypothesis tests for two means

#### Part 1.1: Is it possible to smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease? 


Joy Milne claimed to have the ability to smell whether someone had Parkinson’s disease.

To test this claim, researchers gave Joy 6 shirts that had been worn by people who had Parkinson’s disease and 6 people who did not

Joy identified 11 out of the 12 shirts correctly. 

Let's run a hypothesis test to assess whether there is significant evidence to suggest that Joy can really could smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease.




$\\$





##### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols and words, and set up the rules of the game


**In words:** 

* Null hypothesis: Joy's ability to smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease is a chance guess of 1/2
* Alternative hypothesis: Joy can smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease at a level greater than chance of 1/2



**Using symbols**





**Rules of the game**

If there is a less than 5% probability we would get a random statistic as or more extreme than the observed statistic if $H_0$ was true, then we will reject $H_0$ and say that $H_A$ is likely to be true true. 







$\\$





##### Step 2: Calculate the observed statistic

```{r joy_obs_stat}




```





$\\$





##### Step 3: Create the null distribution



```{r null_dist}






```





$\\$




##### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value}




```





$\\$





##### Step 5: Make a decision






$\\$






**Questions**

 1. Do you believe Joy can really smell Parkinson's disease? 
 
    - What about after [you read this article](https://wapo.st/2lW9GQL)? 

 2. Survey question: Is it better to report the actual p-value or just whether we rejected the null hypothesis $H_0$?

## Part 2: Permutation tests for comparing two means in R


Let's us examine the randomized comparative experiment by Lyle et al (1987) to assess whether calcium lowered blood pressure.








##### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses 







$\\$






##### Step 2a: Plot the data


```{r pill_plot}



treat <- c(7, -4, 18, 17, -3, -5,  1, 10, 11, -2)
control <- c(-1,  12,  -1,  -3,   3,  -5,   5,   2, -11,  -1,  -3)



# plot the data










```




$\\$




##### Step 2b: Calculate the observed statistic

```{r pill_obs_stat}





```


$\\$





##### Step 3: Create the null distribution



```{r null_dist_pill}


# combine the data from the treatment and control groups together



# use a for loop to create shuffled treatment and control groups and shuffled statistics 









# plot the null distribution as a histogram






```



$\\$




##### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value_pill}


# plot the null distribution again with a red line a the value of the observed statistic




# calculate the p-value






```




$\\$



##### Step 5: Make a decision
