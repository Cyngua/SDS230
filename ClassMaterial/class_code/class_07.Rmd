```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# install.packages("latex2exp")

library(latex2exp)

#knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=6, fig.height=4)

<!--  Please run the code in the R chunk below once. It will install a packages, and and download figures/data we will use.  -->

```{r MAD_statistic}

## Part 1: Randomization tests for comparing two means in R


Let's us examine the randomized comparative experiment by Lyle et al (1987) to assess whether calcium lowered blood pressure.




### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses 







$\\$






### Step 2a: Plot the data


```{r pill_plot}



treat <- c(7, -4, 18, 17, -3, -5,  1, 10, 11, -2)
control <- c(-1,  12,  -1,  -3,   3,  -5,   5,   2, -11,  -1,  -3)



# plot the data











```






$\\$






### Step 2b: Calculate the observed statistic

```{r pill_obs_stat}




```




$\\$





### Step 3: Create the null distribution



```{r null_dist_pill}


# combine the data from the treatment and control groups together




# use a for loop to create shuffled treatment and control groups and shuffled statistics 













```






$\\$







### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value_pill}


# plot the null distribution again with a red line a the value of the observed statistic










# calculate the p-value





```




$\\$



### Step 5: Make a decision

## Part 2: Permutation test comparing more than two means in R



Is there differences between the average amount of beer that countries in different continents drink? Let's explore this more below!

Note: This question was inspired by these sources:

### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses 










$\\$




### Step 2: Calculate the statistic of interest and visualize the data



```{r alcohol_stat}


load("alcohol.rda")



# look at the average number of beers consumed per capita in each country




# view a box plot of the data




# use the get_MAD_stat() defined at the top of this R Markdown document to get the observed statistic




```





$\\$






### Step 3: Create a null distribution


To create a null distribution, we need to create a statistic consistent with the null hypothesis, and then repeat the process many times. 

We can create a MAD statistic consistent with the null hypothesis by shuffling the continent names and then recalculate the MAD statistic on the shuffled data. To shuffle the data we can use the `sample()` function. 

Because calculating the MAD statistic is slow, let's only create 1,000 points in our null distribution.


```{r alcohol_null}


# create the null distribution






```






$\\$







### Step 4: Calculate the p-value




```{r alcohol_pval}

# visualize the null distribution





# calculate the p-value




```



$\\$





### Step 5: Conclusion

## What is the underlying population/random process we are making claims about???


Every time you do an analysis that involves statistical inference (e.g., every time you create a confidence interval, run a hypothesis tests, etc.) you are trying to answer a question about some larger underlying population or random process. For the hypothesis test run here that looks at the relationship between beer consumption and continents, what is the underlying population/process we are trying to make inferences about?
