## Comparing models with R^2, adjusted R^2, AIC, BIC and cross-validation


As we discussed, we can compare models using several measures including $R^2$, $R^2_{adj}$, $AIC$, $BIC$ and cross-validation. Let's try this out on the baseball data.

#### Part 1.1: Comparing models with R^2, adjusted R^2, AIC, BIC


Let's compare our predictions of runs in baseball using the model with the original variables and the model that also includes the variables that includes statistics normalized by at bats. As we saw in the class videos, the variables that contain values normalized by at bats are redundant, so we might prefer models that do not contain these redundant variables. Let's see how our different statistics that assess model fit rank models that contain the redundant variables vs. models that do not contain these redundant variables.

The statistics we will look at are: 

 * R^2: higher means a better fit
 * Adjusted R^2: higher means a better fit
 * AIC: lower means a better model
 * BIC: lower means a better model


```{r}


library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)


# selecting our variables of interest and mutating on the redundant variables
team_batting2 <- Teams %>%
  select(yearID, teamID, G,  W,  L, R,  AB,  H,  X2B, X3B,  HR,  BB,  SO, SB, CS,  HBP, SF) %>%
  mutate(X1B = H - (X2B + X3B + HR),    
         X1Bn = X1B/AB, 
         X2Bn = X2B/AB, 
         X3Bn = X3B/AB, 
         XHRn = HR/AB, 
         XBBn = BB/AB)                        


# fitting a model with the useful statistics and a model with both useful and redundant statistics



# summarizing these models



# printing the R^2 values
cat('R^2 \n')



# printing the adjusted R^2 values
cat("\n Adjusted R^2 \n")



# printing the AIC values
cat("\n AIC \n")



# printing the BIC values
cat("\n BIC \n")



```

#### Part 1.2: Cross-validation


Let's now compare the models using cross-validation. To keep things simple, we are just going to split the data once into a training set and a test set rather than do k-fold cross-validation. 

We will compare the models based on their mean squared prediction error (MSPE) where a smaller MSPE is better. 



```{r}


# create the training set and the test set





# fit both models on the training data, and calculate the MSPE based on thier predictions on the test set









```
