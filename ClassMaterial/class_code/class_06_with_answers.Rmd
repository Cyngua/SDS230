# Overview

 * Hypothesis tests for a single proportion in R
 * Hypothesis tests for two means




## Part 1: Running a randomization test for a single proportion in R



$\\$





### Part 1.1: Is it possible to smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease? 


Joy Milne claimed to have the ability to smell whether someone had Parkinson’s disease.

To test this claim, researchers gave Joy 6 shirts that had been worn by people who had Parkinson’s disease and 6 people who did not

Joy identified 11 out of the 12 shirts correctly. 

Let's run a hypothesis test to assess whether there is significant evidence to suggest that Joy can really could smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease.




$\\$





#### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols and words, and set up the rules of the game


**In words:** 

* Null hypothesis: Joy's ability to smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease is a chance guess of 1/2
* Alternative hypothesis: Joy can smell whether someone has Parkinson's disease at a level greater than chance of 1/2



**Using symbols**

$H_0: \pi = 0.5$
$H_A: \pi > 0.5$



**Rules of the game**

If there is a less than 5% probability we would get a random statistic as or more extreme than the observed statistic if $H_0$ was true, then we will reject $H_0$ and say that $H_A$ is likely to be true true. 


$\alpha = 0.05$




$\\$





#### Step 2: Calculate the observed statistic

```{r joy_obs_stat}

(obs_stat <- 11/12)

```





$\\$





#### Step 3: Create the null distribution



```{r null_dist}

flip_sims <- rbinom(10000, 12, .5)

flip_sims_prop <- flip_sims/12

barplot(table(flip_sims), 
        xlab = "Number of heads (i.e., correct guesses)", 
        ylab = "Number of simulations",
        main = "10,000 simulations of 12 coin flips")

hist(flip_sims_prop, breaks = 100)

table(flip_sims)


```






$\\$





#### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value}


(p_value <- sum(flip_sims_prop >= obs_stat)/length(flip_sims))


```






$\\$






#### Step 5: Make a decision

Since `r p_value` is less than $\alpha = 0.05$ we can reject the null hypothesis (and perhaps say the results are "statistically significant")






$\\$






**Questions**

 1. Do you believe Joy can really smell Parkinson's disease? 
 
    - What about after [you read this article](https://wapo.st/2lW9GQL)? 

 2. Is it better to report the actual p-value or just whether we rejected the null hypothesis $H_0$?

## Part 2: Permutation tests for comparing two means in R


Let's us examine the randomized comparative experiment by Lyle et al (1987) to assess whether calcium lowered blood pressure.







#### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses 


$H_0: \mu_{treat} - \mu_{control} = 0$
$H_A: \mu_{treat} - \mu_{control} > 0$


$\alpha = 0.05$




$\\$






#### Step 2a: Plot the data


```{r pill_plot}



treat <- c(7, -4, 18, 17, -3, -5,  1, 10, 11, -2)
control <- c(-1,  12,  -1,  -3,   3,  -5,   5,   2, -11,  -1,  -3)



# plot the data
boxplot(treat, control, 
        names = c("Treatment", "Control"),
        main = "Comparison of decrease in blood pressure",
        ylab = "Blood pressure decrease")



# create a stripchart
data_list <- list(treat, control) 
  
stripchart(data_list, 
           group.names = c("treatment", "control"), 
           main = "Comparison of decrease in blood pressure",
           xlab = "Blood pressure decrease", 
           col = c("red", "blue"))


```






$\\$






#### Step 2b: Calculate the observed statistic

```{r pill_obs_stat}


obs_stat <- mean(treat) - mean(control)



```


$\\$





#### Step 3: Create the null distribution



```{r null_dist_pill}


# combine the data from the treatment and control groups together
combined_data <- c(treat, control)


# use a for loop to create shuffled treatment and control groups and shuffled statistics 
null_distribution <-  NULL
for (i in 1:10000) {

       # shuffle data
        shuff_data <- sample(combined_data)

        # create fake treatment and control groups
        shuff_treat   <-  shuff_data[1:10]
        shuff_control  <-  shuff_data[11:21]

        # save the statistic of interest
        null_distribution[i] <- mean(shuff_treat) - mean(shuff_control)

        
}


# plot the null distribution as a histogram
hist(null_distribution, 
     nclass = 200,
     main = "Null distribution", 
     xlab = TeX("$\\bar{x}_{shuff-treat} - \\bar{x}_{shuff-control}$"))




```






$\\$







#### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value_pill}


# plot the null distribution again with a red line a the value of the observed statistic
hist(null_distribution, 
     nclass = 200,
     main = "Null distribution", 
     xlab = TeX("$\\bar{x}_{shuff-treat} - \\bar{x}_{shuff-control}$"))


abline(v = obs_stat, col = "red")



# calculate the p-value
(p_value <- sum(null_distribution >= obs_stat)/10000)




```




$\\$



#### Step 5: Make a decision

Since `r p_value` is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$ we can not reject the null hypothesis. Thus if we are using the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, we do not have sufficient evidence to say that the pill is effective.
