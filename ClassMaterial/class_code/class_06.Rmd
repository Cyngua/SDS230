## Part 2: Examining how data is distributed using quantile-quantile plots


We can check if empirical data seems to come from a particular distribution using quantile-quantile plots (qqplots). qqplots plot the sorted data values in your sample as a function of the theoretical quantile values (at evenly spaced probability areas).

Below is an illustration of quantile values for 10 data points that come from a normal distribution. If we have 10 data points in our sample, then to create a qqplot comparing our data to a standard normal distribution we would plot our data as a function of these theoretical quantile values. If the plot falls along a diagonal line, this indicates our data comes from the standard normal distribution 

Also see [this explanation](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/q-q-plots/)

![](qq-plot.png)



Let's create a qqplot to assess whether the heights of baseball players to see if they are normally distributed.



```{r qqplots}


# get the heights of all baseball players
library(Lahman)
all_heights <- People$height


# remove missing values
all_heights <- all_heights[!is.na(all_heights)]


# view a histogram of baseball player heights



# create an sequence of values between 0 and 1 at even spaces



# get the quantiles from these values




# create the qqplot





```



$\\$




We can also use the qqnorm() function to do this more easily when comparing data to the normal distribution.


```{r qqnorm}




```



This data is pretty normal as can see in the plots above. Let's look at some highly skewed data.



```{r skewed_qqplot}



# data that is skewed to the right
exp_data <- rexp(1000)







# data that is skewed to the left
exp_data <- -1 * rexp(1000)






```

## Part 3: Review of confidence intervals and the bootstrap




$\\$


Let's review confidence intervals, our Wits and Wagers confidence interval estimates, and let's examine some formulas that can give us standard errors for $\bar{x}$ and $\hat{p}$...




$\\$






## Part 4: The bootstrap

The bootstrap is a method that can be used to estimate confidence intervals for a large range of parameters. 

The central concept behind the bootstrap is the "plug-in principle" where we treat our sample of data as if it were the population. We then sample *with replacement* from out sample to create a *bootstrap distribution* which is a proxy for (the spread of) the sampling distribution. 



$\\$



#### Part 4.1: Creating a bootstrap distribution in R


To sample data in R we can use the `sample(the_data)` function. To sample data with replacement we use the `replace = TRUE` argument, i.e., `sample(the_data, replace = TRUE)`.  

Below we calculate the bootstrap distribution for the heights of baseball players using just first 20 baseball players.


```{r}


# get the heights from the first 20 baseball players
sample_heights <- all_heights[1:20] 

# create the bootstrap distribution
bootstrap_dist <- NULL
for (i in 1:10000){
  boot_sample <- sample(sample_heights, replace = TRUE)
  bootstrap_dist[i] <- mean(boot_sample)
}


# plot the bootstrap distribution to make sure it looks normal
hist(bootstrap_dist, 
     nclass = 100, 
     xlab = TeX("$\\bar{x}$^*"), 
     main = "Histogram of the bootstrap distribution")



```


$\\$



#### Part 4.2: Calculating the bootstrap standard error SE*


The standard deviation of the *bootstrap distribution* is usually a good approximation of the standard deviation of the sampling distrubition - i.e, it is a good approximation of the *standard error SE*.

When our bootstrap distribution is relatively normal, we can use the fact that 95% of values fall within to standard deviations of a normal distribution to calculate 95% confidence intervals as:

$CI_{95} = [stat - 2 \cdot SE^*,  stat + 2 \cdot SE^*]$

For example, for a our bootstrap distribution we have a 95% confidence interval for the mean $\mu$ as: 

$CI_{95} = [\bar{x} - 2 \cdot SE^*,  \bar{x} + 2 \cdot SE^*]$




```{r bootstrap_SE}

# calculate the bootstrap standard error SE* as the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution 


# critical value for the 95% CI 



# calculate the 95% CI using SE*





```


$\\$


Above we are using the bootstrap to create a 95% confidence interval which should capture the mean height $\mu_{height}$


**Question:** What is the population that $\mu$ represents? 

 a) The data set (data frame) of 19,141 baseball players?
 b) All past and potentially future baseball players? 
 d) All US citizens?
 e) ...

 
It is important to define what the larger population is when doing statistical inference since you are really only answering questions about this population. 





$\\$



#### Part 4.3: Did our confidence interval capture the parameter? 



Suppose the population is just the dataset of heights of all 19,141 baseball players. Did our confidence interval based on the bootstrap capture the true parameter $\mu$? 



```{r mu_in_CI}

# Plotting the confidence interval again



# If our dataset is the population, we can calculate the parameter for the mean



```



$\\$





#### Part 4.4: Bootstrap percentile method

If the bootstrap is symmetric but not normal, we can use the bootstrap percentile method to create confidence intervals. 


```{r bootstrap_percentile}

# 95% CI using the bootstrap percentile method


 
# testing whether our bootstrap distribution is normal


```





$\\$






## Part 5: Formulas for the standard error


For particular statistics, there are formulas that give the standard error.



$\\$



#### Part 5.1: Formula for the standard error of the mean $\bar{x}$


When our statistic of interest is the mean $\bar{x}$, the formula to compute the standard error of the mean is:


(1) $\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

and an estimate for this is given by:

(2) $s_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

Where:

* $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, 
* *s* is the standard deviation statistic computed from a sample of size *n* 
* *n* is the sample size. 

Note, equation 1 above is a theoretical construct since we will never know $\sigma$ (only Plato knows this) while equation 2 above is possible to calculate from a sample of data. 


Let's use formula 2 to calculate the  $s_{\bar{x}}$:


```{r part_5_1}






```






$\\$






#### Part 5.2: Formula for the standard error of a proportion $\hat{p}$


When our statistic of interest is the sample proportion $\hat{p}$, the formula to compute the standard error of a proportion is:


(1) $\sigma_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi (1 - \pi)}{n}}$

and an estimate for this is given by:

(2) $s_{\bar{x}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} (1 - \hat{p})}{n}}$

Where:

* $\pi$ is the population proportion 
* $\hat{p}$ is the proportion from a sample of size *n* 
* *n* is the sample size. 

Again, equation 1 above is a theoretical construct since we will never know $\pi$ (only Plato knows this) while equation 2 above is possible to calculate from a sample of data. 



$\\$



**Question**: If we have formulas for the standard error of these statistics, why use the bootstrap?  


**Answers:** 

1. The bootstrap works for many statistics that do not have formulas for standard errors
2. The bootstrap can be used in cases where the sampling distribution is not normal, in which case we can use the bootstrap percentile method.




$\\$




#### Part 5.3: Bootstrap for CIs for proportions


```{r bootstrap_proportion}

library(okcupiddata)

# get drug use behavior for first 50 OkCupid users
(type_of_drug_user_50 <- na.omit(profiles$drugs)[1:50])

# calculate the p-hat statistic for "sometimes" drug users
obs_stat <- sum(type_of_drug_user_50 == "sometimes")/50

# create the bootstrap distribution by creating 10,000 bootstrap statistics
# through sampling with replacement




# plot a histogram of the bootstrap distribution




# calculate the 95% CI using the percentile method



# bootstrap estimate of the standard error, SE*




# calculate the CI using the formula...




# create the CI using the SE from the formula




```
