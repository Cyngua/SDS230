## Part 1: Permutation test comparing more than two means in R




<!-- Code to calculate the MAD statistic that we will use in our hypothesis test -->

```{r MAD_statistic}

# a function to get the MAD statistic
get_MAD_stat <- function(quantitative_data, grouping_data) {
  
 # we can use the by() function to get the means separately for each group
 group_means <- as.vector(by(quantitative_data, grouping_data, mean, na.rm = TRUE))

  total <- 0 
  num_group_pairs <- 0
  
  for (iGroup1 in 1:(length(group_means) - 1)) {
    for (iGroup2 in (iGroup1 + 1):(length(group_means))) {
      
      total <- total + abs(group_means[iGroup1] - group_means[iGroup2])
      num_group_pairs <- num_group_pairs + 1
      
    }
  }
  
  total/num_group_pairs
  
}  # end of the MAD function

### Examining beer drinking behavior across different continents...



Is there differences between the average amount of beer that countries in different continents drink? Let's explore this more below!

Note: This question was inspired by these sources:

### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses 


$H_0: \mu_{Africa} = \mu_{Asia} =  \mu_{Europe} = \mu_{North America} = \mu_{Oceania} = \mu_{South America}$

$H_A: \mu_{i} \ne \mu_{j}$ for some groups i and j


$\alpha = 0.05$





$\\$




### Step 2: Calculate the statistic of interest and visualize the data



```{r alcohol_stat}

# SDS230::download_data("alcohol.rda")

load("alcohol.rda")

# how many countries are in each continent
table(alcohol$continent)

# look at the average number of beers consumed per capita in each country
by(alcohol$beer_servings, alcohol$continent, mean)


# view a box plot of the data
boxplot(beer_servings ~ continent, data = alcohol)


# use the get_MAD_stat() defined at the top of this R Markdown document to get the observed statistic
(obs_stat <- get_MAD_stat(alcohol$beer_servings, alcohol$continent))



```





$\\$






### Step 3: Create a null distribution


To create a null distribution, we need to create a statistic consistent with the null hypothesis, and then repeat the process many times. 

We can create a MAD statistic consistent with the null hypothesis by shuffling the continent names and then recalculate the MAD statistic on the shuffled data. To shuffle the data we can use the `sample()` function. 

Because calculating the MAD statistic is slow, let's only create 1,000 points in our null distribution.


```{r alcohol_null}


# create the null distribution
null_dist <- NULL
for (i in 1:1000) {
  
  null_dist[i] <- get_MAD_stat(alcohol$beer_servings, sample(alcohol$continent))
  
}


```






$\\$







### Step 4: Calculate the p-value




```{r alcohol_pval}

# visualize the null distribution
hist(null_dist, xlim = c(0, 80))
abline(v = obs_stat, col = "red")


# calculate the p-value
(pval <- sum(null_dist >= obs_stat)/length(null_dist))


```



$\\$





### Step 5: Conclusion


The p-value is less than our significance level of $alpha = 0.05$ so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are differences in alcohol consumption between different continents.





$\\$






## What is the underlying population/random process we are making claims about???


Every time you do an analysis that involves statistical inference (e.g., every
time you create a confidence interval, run a hypothesis tests, etc.) you are
trying to answer a question about some larger underlying population or random
process. For the hypothesis test run here that looks at the relationship between
beer consumption and continents, what is the underlying population/process we
are trying to make inferences about?

## Part 2: Permutation tests for comparing two means using a t-statistic


Let's us reexamine the randomized controlled trial experiment by Solomon et al
(2002) to see if there is evidence that taking a gingko pills affects cognition.





### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses 


$H_0: \mu_{gingko} - \mu_{placebo} = 0$
$H_A: \mu_{gingko} - \mu_{placebo} \ne 0$


$\alpha = 0.05$




$\\$






### Step 2a: Plot the data


```{r pill_plot}


load("gingko_RCT.rda")


# plot the data
boxplot(gingko, placebo, 
        names = c("Gingko", "Placebo"),
        ylab = "Memory score")



# create a stripchart
data_list <- list(gingko, placebo) 
  

stripchart(data_list, 
           group.names = c("Gingko", "Placebo"), 
           method = "jitter",
           xlab = "Memory score", 
           col = c("red", "blue"))


```





$\\$





### Step 2b: Calculate the observed statistic using a t-statistic


The formula for a t-statistic is: 

$$t = \frac{\bar{x}_t - \bar{x}_c}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_t}{n_t} + \frac{s^2_c}{n_c}}}$$




```{r pill_obs_stat}


numerator <- mean(gingko) - mean(placebo)

demoninator <- sqrt(   var(gingko)/length(gingko) + var(placebo)/length(placebo)    )

(obs_stat <- numerator/demoninator)


```





$\\$






### Step 3: Create the null distribution using a permutation/randomization test



```{r null_dist_pill}


# combine the data from the treatment and control groups together
combined_data <- c(gingko, placebo)

n_gingko <- length(gingko)
total <- length(combined_data)

# use a for loop to create shuffled treatment and control groups and shuffled statistics 
null_distribution <-  NULL
for (i in 1:10000) {

       # shuffle data
        shuff_data <- sample(combined_data)

        # create fake treatment and control groups
        shuff_gingko   <-  shuff_data[1:n_gingko]
        shuff_placebo  <-  shuff_data[(n_gingko + 1):total]

        numerator_shuff <- mean(shuff_gingko) - mean(shuff_placebo)
        
        demoninator_shuff <- sqrt(var(shuff_gingko)/length(shuff_gingko) + 
                                  var(shuff_placebo)/length(shuff_placebo))

        # save the statistic of interest
        null_distribution[i] <- numerator_shuff/demoninator_shuff

        
}


# plot the null distribution as a histogram
hist(null_distribution, 
     breaks = 100,
     main = "Null distribution", 
     xlab = "t-statistic")




```





$\\$






### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value_pill}


# plot the null distribution again with a red line a the value of the observed statistic
hist(null_distribution, 
     breaks = 100,
     main = "Null distribution", 
     xlab = "t-statistic")


abline(v = obs_stat, col = "red")
abline(v = abs(obs_stat), col = "red")



# calculate the p-value
(p_value_left_tail <- sum(null_distribution <= obs_stat)/10000)
(p_value_right_tail <- sum(null_distribution >= abs(obs_stat))/10000)

(p_value <- p_value_left_tail + p_value_right_tail)



```





$\\$





### Step 5: Make a decision

Since `r p_value` is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$ we can not reject the null hypothesis. Thus if we are using the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, we do not have sufficient evidence to say that the pill is effective. 



When we used a statistic of $\bar{x}_t - \bar{x}_c$ in our randomization test in class 7 we got a p-value of 0.127. How do these results compare? 





$\\$







## Part 3: Parametric tests for comparing two means in R


Let's redo this analysis using a parametric probability distribution, which in this case is the t-distribution. The same 5 steps of hypothesis testing apply here as well!




$\\$




### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses 


Same as before...


$H_0: \mu_{gingko} - \mu_{placebo} = 0$
$H_A: \mu_{gingko} - \mu_{placebo} > 0$


$\alpha = 0.05$




$\\$





### Step 2b: Calculate the observed statistic using a t-statistic


Same as before: 


$$t = \frac{\bar{x}_t - \bar{x}_c}{\sqrt{\frac{s^2_t}{n_t} + \frac{s^2_c}{n_c}}}$$




```{r pill_obs_stat2}


numerator <- mean(gingko) - mean(placebo)

demoninator <- sqrt(   var(gingko)/length(gingko) + var(placebo)/length(placebo)    )


(obs_stat <- numerator/demoninator)


```




$\\$




### Step 3: Create the null distribution



We will now use a parametric t-distribution (i.e., density function) as a null distribution. The t-distribution has one parameter called "degrees of freedom". We will set this parameter as the minimum of $n_t - 1$ or $n_c - 1$. 


What are the degrees of freedom for this study? 


Let's visualize the t-distribution


```{r t_density}


# visualize the t-distribution density curve using the dt() function 

(degree_free <- min(length(gingko), length(placebo)) - 1)

x_vals <- seq(-5, 5, by = .01)
y_vals <- dt(x_vals, degree_free)

plot(x_vals, y_vals, type = "l", col = "blue")



# how does this compare to our t-distribution created by shuffling? 

hist(null_distribution, freq = FALSE,
     breaks = 50,
     main = "Null distribution", 
     xlab = "t-statistic")

points(x_vals, y_vals, type = "l", col = "blue")


```





$\\$






### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


We can get $Pr(X < stat)$ for a t-distribution using the `pt()` function.



```{r p_value_pill2}


(p_value_left_tail <-  pt(obs_stat, degree_free, lower.tail = TRUE))
(p_value_right_tail <-  pt(abs(obs_stat), degree_free, lower.tail = FALSE))

(p_value <- p_value_left_tail + p_value_right_tail)


```





$\\$





### Step 5: Make a decision


How does our p-value and decision compare to the p-value decision we got from the permutation test? 






$\\$






### Built in R functions for t-tests

We can use the built in `t.test()` function to run a t-test as well. 

Note: If you want to run one-tailed tests you can use the extra argument `alternative` argument.



```{r t_test}

t.test(gingko, placebo)


```


Why is the p-value slightly different than what we got when we used the `pt()` function?
