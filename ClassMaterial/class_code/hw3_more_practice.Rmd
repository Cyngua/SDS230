## Part 1: Any questions?

## Part 2: Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for a single proportion 


Paul the Octopus was an octopus who became famous for predicting winners of soccer matches during the 2010 World Cup. To examine Paul's psychic abilities, two containers of food (mussels) were lowered into the Paul's tank prior to each soccer game. The containers were identical, except for country flags of the opposing teams, one on each container. Whichever container Paul opened first was deemed his predicted winner. 

Paul (in a German aquarium) became famous for correctly predicting 11 out of 13 soccer games during the 2010 World Cup. Let's use hypothesis testing to examine whether Paul is actually psychic or if he was merely guessing.   




$\\$






**Part 2.1 (5 points)**: State the null and alternative hypotheses testing whether Paul is psychic using both words and in the appropriate symbols.  Also describe what the significance level means and denote it with the commonly used symbol and commonly used value.



**Answer**:




$\\$






**Part 2.2 (5 points) **: Compute the statistic of interest and save it in an object paul_stat. Do you think it is likely you would get a statistic this extreme if Paul was guessing? 
```{r problem_2_2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
  

  # calculate the observed statistic
 
  
    
```


**Answer**: 







$\\$






**Part 2.3 (5 points) **: Now use the rbinom() function to generate a null distribution that would occur if Paul was guessing, and save the results in an object called null_distribution. 

Remember that the arguments to the rbinom(num_sims, size, prob) are: 

 * num_sims: the number of simulations to run
 * size:  the number of "coin flips" in each simulation
 * prob:  the probability of getting heads on each coin flip. 

Also create a table showing counts (frequencies) for the different proportions of "heads" the simulations produced, and plot this null distribution table as a bar plot. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
    
   

        
```





$\\$





**Part 2.4 (5 points)**: Now use the variables null_distribution and paul_stat to calculate the number of simulations that had a higher proportion of "heads" than the proportion of predictions Paul's got correct. Convert this to a p-value by dividing by the total number of simulations. Does this p-value provide evidence that Paul is psychic? 

```{r problem_2_4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
    
   
    
```

**Answer**: 






$\\$






**Part 2.5 (2.5 points)** Make a judgement call as to whether you believe Paul is psychic based on the p-value and any other information you think is releveant. Make sure to justify your answer to explain Paul's prediction abilities.  




**Answer**: 






$\\$





**Part 2.6 (10 points)** Calculate the confidence interval for Paul's prediction abilities using the bootstrap methods
```{r problem_2_6, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
    

  # a vector of Paul's answers whether they were correct or incorrect (not necessarily in the order)


  # continue creating the bootstrap distribution from here 
  
   
  
  # plot the boostrap distribution

  
  # CI using the bootstrap based on a normal approximation to the bootstrap distribution  
  
  
  
  # CI using the bootstrap percentile method


   
```


**Answer**: 





$\\$









**Part 2.7 (5 points)** There is also a formula for calculating the standard error of a proportion which is:

$s_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$


Use this formula to create 95% confidence intervals and compare it to the 95% confidence intervals you calculated in the previous problem. Do they appear to be similar? 


```{r}




```


**Answer**

## Part 3: Permutation tests for comparing two means - Sleep or Caffeine for Memory?




The consumption of caffeine to benefit alertness is a common activity practiced by 90% of adults in North America. Often caffeine is used in order to replace the need for sleep. One recent study compared studentsâ€™ ability to recall memorized information after either the consumption of caffeine or a brief sleep (see [Mednick et al., 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18554731)

A random sample of 35 adults (between the ages of 18 and 39) were randomly divided into three groups and verbally given a list of 24 words to memorize. During a break, one of the groups took a nap for an hour and a half, another group was kept awake and then given a caffeine pill an hour prior to the testing, and a third group was given a placebo. The response variable of interest is the number of words participants are able to recall following the break. 


Let's run a hypothesis test to see if there is statistically significant difference in the mean number of words recalled between the group that got *sleep* and the group that got *caffeine* (we will ignore the placebo group since I don't have data from that group). 





$\\$





**Part 3.0 (5 points)**  The data for the number of words recalled by members in each of the two groups is below. Start by creating a side by side boxplot comparing the two groups. Describe below whether there appears to be a difference between the groups.


```{r sleep_caffeine_data}

sleep_condition <- c(14, 18, 11, 13, 18, 17, 21, 9, 16, 17, 14, 15)
caffeine_condition <- c(12, 12, 14, 13, 6, 18, 14, 16, 10, 7, 15, 10)






```


**Answer**:  






$\\$





In parts 3.1 to 3.5 you will now do the 5 steps to run a hypothesis test...



$\\$




**Part 3.1 (5 points)** State the null and alternative hypotheses using words and symbols. Also describe the significance level is and denote it with the appropriate symbol. 




**Answer**:  






$\\$





**Part 3.2 (5 points)**  Calculate the value of that statistic for the observed sample, and use the appropriate symbol notation along with its value below. 


```{r observed_statistic}

 


```



**Answer**:  








$\\$







**Part 3.3 (10 points)** Create a null distribution using a permutation test (i.e., combine data from both groups, randomly assign them to a fake "caffeine" and "sleep group", calculate a null statistic, and repeat 100,000 times to get a null distribution). Also plot a histogram of the null distribution and add a red vertical line to the plot at the value of the observed statistic.  


```{r null_distribution}







```




$\\$





**Part 3.4 (5 points)** Now calculate the p-value in the R chunk below. 

```{r p_value}




```






$\\$







**Part 3.5 (2.5 points)** Are the results seem statistical significant? What would we conclude if we used a strictly "Neyman-Pearson paradigm" where we only reject results that are less than our significance level? Do you believe there is a difference between these groups? 




**Answers**:  





$\\$





**Part 3.6 (5 points)** Parametric hypothesis tests are hypothesis tests where the null distribution is given by a mathematical density function. When comparing two means, a parametric hypothesis test, that you likely learned about in introductory statistics, is the t-test, where the null distribution is a t-distribution. 

R has a built in function called `t.test(sample1, sample2)` that takes two samples of data and runs a t-test on them. Use this function to compare the sleep and caffeine groups and report if there is a statistically significant difference between the groups. Also report the 95% confidence interval that the t.test function returns and describe whether this confidence interval is consistent with it being plausiable that there is no difference between the population means of these two groups. 


```{r t_test}




```
